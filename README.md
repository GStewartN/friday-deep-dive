# Friday Deep Dive

Epicodus-React, Week 3 Independent Project

_Nathan Stewart_ 09.22.2017

## Discription

This project is a plan for my unstructured study/project day. I will lay out my goals for the day, get started, then provide a list of what was actually accomplished at the end of the day. I will also provide links to any relevant material that was completed.

## Morning Plan/Goal

* Thorough review of Epicodus curriculum from the last two weeks. Focus on personal sticky points: Component Lifecycle Methods, Lifting State, and Unit Testing.

* Watch and study React and React-Reduct video series on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/technologies/react).
 * Up and running with React - Shane Osbourne
 * Getting Started with Redux - Dan Abramov
 * Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux - Dan Abramov


* Refactor project from last Friday to bring into line with the current week curriculum, and possibly some new tricks from the Egghead.io courses.
